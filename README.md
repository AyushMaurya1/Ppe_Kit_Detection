# PPE Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a **PPE Detection System**, **Human Detection using YOLOv3**, and **Face Recognition**. These systems can analyze images, videos, or webcam feeds to detect compliance with safety requirements, human presence, and recognize faces. Alerts are triggered when violations are detected, such as non-compliance with PPE or an unknown face.

## Features

- **Image Detection**: Analyze images for PPE compliance.
- **Video Detection**: Process video files to detect non-compliance.
- **Webcam Detection**: Monitor a live webcam feed for PPE violations.
- **Audio Alert**: Plays a buzzer sound when non-compliance is detected.
- **Real-Time Display**: Annotated outputs with detected objects are displayed.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### Dependencies

Install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy pygame
pip install opencv-python-headless  # For YOLOv3 Human Detection



**Files Needed**

PPE Detection Model:

yolo.pt: Trained YOLO model for PPE detection (helmets, vests, gloves).
person.pt: For human detection

Human Detection Model:

yolov3.weights: YOLOv3 pre-trained weights.
yolov3.cfg: YOLOv3 configuration file.
coco.names: Class names for YOLOv3.

Face Recognition:

Known Faces: Folder containing images of known individuals for face recognition (e.g., person1.jpg, person2.jpg).
Cascade Classifier: For face detection, a pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml should be used.
Audio Alert:

buzzer.wav: The buzzer sound to trigger on violation detection.

**Usage**

1. Human Detection
To run human detection:

bash
Copy code
python human_detection.py
Prepare Video Files:
Place your video files in the videos directory.
Supported formats: .mp4, .avi.
Processing:
The script processes all videos in the videos folder.
It detects humans in each video and saves the processed videos in processed_videos.

2. PPE Detection
To run the PPE detection system:
python ppe_detection.py

Select Model:

PPE Model: Detects PPE (helmets, vests, gloves).
Worker Model: Detects workers in restricted zones.

Select Source:

Image: Provide the path to an image file.
Video: Provide the path to a video file.
Webcam: Use the default webcam for real-time monitoring.

3. Face Recognition
4. 
To run face recognition:
python face_recognition.py
Select Input Type:

Image: Provide the path to an image file.
Video: Provide the path to a video file.
Webcam: Use the default webcam for real-time face recognition.
Known Faces Folder:

Place images of known individuals in the known_faces folder (e.g., person1.jpg, person2.jpg).

**Key Functions**

PPE Detection:

Buzzer Alert: Plays a buzzer sound when PPE violations are detected.
YOLOv8 Model: Dynamically loads the YOLOv8 model to detect PPE and workers.
Real-Time Display: Shows annotated output for detected PPE.
Human Detection (YOLOv3):

Human Detection: Identifies humans in video frames.
Processed Videos: Annotated videos are saved in the processed_videos folder.
Face Recognition:

Face Identification: Matches faces in images or videos with known individuals.
Real-Time Webcam Feed: Supports live webcam recognition.


**Configuration**

Modify the neceassry paths in the scripts as per your system.
